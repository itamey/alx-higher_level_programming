# List Of Programs In This Project

### 0-print_list_integer.py
Prints out the content of a list of numbers to the screen. Each element (number) is printed on a newline.

### 1-element_at.py
Returns the content of the list: `my_list` at the specified index: `idx`. Returns `None` if `idx` is negative or out of range.

### 2-replace_in_list.py
Returns a new list created by replacing the content of the old list `my_list` at the specified index `idx`. If `idx` is negative or out of range, then return the old list `my_list` unaltered.

### 3-print_reversed_list_integer.py
Prints out the elements of a list of integers in reverse. Prints one element per newline.

### 4-new_in_list.py
Replaces the value of an element at a specific index `idx` in new and seperate copy of the list `my_list`.

### 5-no_c.py
Contains a function `no_c` which takes a string as it's argument and returns a new string in which any occurences of the letters `c` or `C` have been removed.

### 6-print_matrix_integer.py
Prints out the contents of a matrix to the screen.

### 7-add_tuple.py
Adds the values of two elements from a tuple together and assigns the result of the addition to the corresponding elements in a two-element tuple.

### 8-multiple_returns.py
This contains the function `multiple_returns` which takes a string as it's argument and returns a tuple containing two elements; The `length` of the string and the `first` character in the string.

### 9-max_integer.py
This contains the function `max_integer` which takes a list of integers `my_list` as it's argument, determines which element is the largest and then returns that element.

### 10-divisible_by_2.py
This contains the function `divisible_by_2` which takes a list of integers, evaluates each integer in the list and creates a new list containing the boolean `True` or `False` at the specific index in the new list depending on whether the integer in the original list is divisible by 2 (True) or not (False).

### 11-delete_at.py
This contains the function `delete_at` which takes two arguments; a list `my_list` and an index `idx`. Then it deletes the element at the specified index in the list and returns the result.

### 12-switch.py
switches the values of two variables `a` and `b`.
