# List of Programs In The Project

### 0-rectangle.py
Contains the definition of an empty class `Rectangle`.

### 1-rectangle.py
Contains the definition of a version of the class `Rectangle` with the `width` and `height` properties defined.

### 2-rectangle.py
Contains the definition of a version of the class `Rectangle` with the `area` and `perimeter` instance methods provided for determining the `area` and `perimeter` respectively of the rectangle.

### 3-rectangle.py
Contains the definition of a version of the class `Rectangle` which defines functionality that enables it's shape to be printed out to the screen by the `str` and `print` functions.

### 4-rectangle.py
Contains the definition of a version of the class `Rectangle` which defines the `__str__` and `__repr__` special methods for unofficial and official representation of the rectangle.

### 5-rectangle.py
Contains the definition of a version of the `Rectangle` class which prints the message; `Bye rectangle...` whenever an instance of a `Rectangle` is deleted.

### 6-rectangle.py
Contains the definition of a version of the `Rectangle` class which keeps a count of all instances of the class that have been created, incrementing or decrementing that count as the need arises.

### 7-rectangle.py
Contains the definition of a version of the `Rectangle` class which enables us to change the symbols which are used to represent the rectangle when it is being printed to the screen.

### 8-rectangle.py
Contains the definition of a version of the `Rectangle` class which contains the static method `bigger_or_equal` which is used to determine which among two Rectangles passed into it as arguments is bigger.

### 9-rectangle.py
Contains the definition of a version of the `Rectangle` class which contains the class method `square` which creates a Rectangle of equal `width` and `height`. Hence it uses the `Rectangle` class in order to create a `Square`.
