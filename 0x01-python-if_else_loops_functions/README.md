# List Of Scripts And Programs In This Project

### 0-positive_or_negative.py
This program generates a random number `number` and then determines if it is `positive`, `negative` or `zero`.

### 1-last_digit.py
This script generates a random number, extracts the last digit of that number and then evaluates if the last digit is `greater than 5`, `0` or `less than 6 and not 0`.

### 2-print_alphabet.py
This script prints all the letters of the ASCII alphabet in lowercase.

### 3-print_alphabt.py
This script prints all the letters of the ASCII alphabet except the letters `e` and `q` in lowercase.

### 4-print_hexa.py
This script prints all the numbers from `0` to `98` in decimal and hexadecimal format.

### 5-print_comb2.py
This script prints a comma seperated list of two digit decimal numbers from `0` to `99`.

### 6-print_comb3.py
This script prints a comma seperated list of all unique combinations of two numbers.

### 7-islower.py
contains the function `islower` which takes a character as it's argument and returns `True` if it's a lowercase character. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

### 8-uppercase.py
contains the function `uppercase` which takes a lowercase string as it's argument and prints out the string in uppercase.

### 9-print_last_digit.py
Contains function `print_last_digit` which takes in a decimal number and prints the last digit of that number to the screen.

### 10-add.py
Contains the function `add` which takes `a` and `b` and returns `a + b` as it's result.

### 11-pow.py
Contains the function `pow` which takes `a` and `b` and returns `a ^ b` as it's result.

### 12-fizzbuzz.py
Contains the function `fizzbuzz` which reproduces the classic `FizzBuzz` algorithm for a sample of numbers from `1` to `100`.

### 100-print_tebahpla.py
Prints the alphabet in reverse, alternating between lowercase and uppercase letters.

### 101-remove_char_at.py
